# MedicalAppointmentAnalysis

- In this project I tried to analyze why would some patient not show up for his medical appointment and whether there are reasons for that using the data we have.
- I tried to find some correlation between the different attributes we have and whether the patient shows up or not. This dataset contains 110527 medical appointments and its 14 associated variables ( PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap', SMS_received, No-show )
- In this project I used Python and some of its libraries, i.e., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
