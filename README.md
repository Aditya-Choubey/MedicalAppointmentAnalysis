# MedicalAppointmentAnalysis

- In this project I am trying to analyze why would some patient not show up for his medical appointment and whether there are reasons for that using the data we have.
- We will try to find some correlation between the different attributes we have and whether the patient shows up or not. The dataset we are going to use contains 110527 medical appointments and its 14 associated variables ( PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap', SMS_received, No-show )
- In this project I am going to use Python and some of its libraries, i.e., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
